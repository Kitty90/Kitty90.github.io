<h4>Lo and behold! It's the most wonderful time of the year! No, I haven't lost my marbles, 
    I know full well that Christmas is months away. I'm referring to en annual period of indulgence 
    in 'white gold', a period the Germans lovingly refer to as 'Spargelzeit'. 
    Not a German or a German-enthusiast? What I mean to say is: Let's talk about asparagus.</h4>

<br><p><em>Jump to <a href="#recipe">recipe</a></em>.</p>

<p>The white asparagus, to be more precise. After some due research I discovered that, in many countries, 
    green asparagus are common across the globe and the white asparagus is quite rare. In the Netherlands we can get both, 
    although I prefer the white variety, probably because their seasonal availability has increased 
    my appreciation for them. Oh, who am I kidding? Despite the fact that the only difference between 
    the varieties is that the white was raised as a vampire, deprived of any sunlight, 
    I believe that they simply taste stronger while having a softer texture.</p> 

<p>Now, about the recipe. I know that asparagus are not exactly budget friendly and some of you 
    might therefore consider my processing this 'king of vegetables' into cream a capital offence. 
    However, I assure you, I promised you an ode in the title of this post, and that is exactly what 
    this recipe delivers. I have used every bit of the asparagus to infuse the risotto and make it the 
    star of the dish. The result? A rich, creamy and herby risotto, that honors the asparagus and 
    allows you to enjoy the distinct note of the white gold in every single bite.</p>

<h5><a name="recipe">Recipe: White Asparagus Risotto</a></h5>
<p><b>Ingredients (serves 4)</b>
<ul>
	<li>320 gr / 1.6 cups of Arborio rice</li>
	<li>500 g / 1 lb 2 oz fresh white asparagus</li>
	<li>125 g / 1/2 cup of  mascarpone cheese</li>
	<li>8 - 12 slices prosciutto di Parma (leave out for vegetarian option)</li>
	<li>1 onion</li>
	<li>40 g / 0.2 cup of butter</li>
	<li>2 tbsp extra virgin olive oil</li>
	<li>Parmigiano reggiano, for grating</li>
	<li>1 vegetable stock cube</li>
	<li>bunch of parsley</li>
	<li>ground pepper</li>
	<li>salt</li>
</ul></p>
<p><b>Method</b>
<ol>
	<li>Put a large pot with ample water on the fire. There should be enough water in the pot to submerge 3/4 of the asparagus in upright position. Add a generous amount of salt and bring water to boil.</li>
	<li>Cut the woody bottoms of the asparagus, about 1 cm (1/2 inch).</li>
	<li>To remove the woody outer skin, peel the asparagus with an asparagus peeler (or a potato peeler). Tie the asparagus together with a string. Set the asparagus peels and bottoms aside for the broth.</li>
	<li>Put the asparagus bunch in upright position in the pot with boiling water. Leave to cook for 20 minutes.</li>
	<li>Meanwhile, chop the onion very finely and put it in a bowl.</li>
	<li>Put 20 g of butter and 2 tablespoons of extra virgin olive oil in another bowl.</li>
	<li>After 20 minutes of cooking, take the asparagus out and leave to cool down in a colander.</li>
	<li>Keep 1 l of the cooking liquid and add the stock cube and asparagus peels and bottoms. Bring this broth to a boil and let it simmer.</li>
	<li>Cut 4 cm chunks from the top of the asparagus. These asparagus tips are for garnish.</li>
	<li>Cut the remaining asparagus in chunks. These will be used to make the asparagus cream.</li>
	<li>Put all of the chunks (asparagus tips included) in the bowl with olive oil and butter let the asparagus soak up the liquid.</li>
	<li>Once the asparagus have absorbed the liquid, add one ladle of the broth and leave this to be absorbed as well.</li>
	<li>Meanwhile, toast the Arborio rice briefly and add it to the onion bowl.</li>
	<li>Once the asparagus have absorbed the stock, take out the asparagus tips and set aside.</li>
	<li>Add the mascarpone to the asparagus chunks and mix well, so the asparagus seem to be swimming in yogurt.</li>
	<li>Blend the asparagus mixture with a handmixer until they are completely pureed and you are left with a silky, creamy asparagus sauce.</li>
	<li>Add a lug of olive oil to a sauce pan on medium heat and add the rice and onion. Add a ladleful of stock to the rice and bring to a boil.</li>
	<li>When the risotto is boiling, turn the heat down to a simmer, and let the rice absorb the stock, stirring continuously. Keep adding ladlefuls of stock to the rice, allowing each ladleful to be absorbed before adding the next.</li>
	<li>After about 10 minutes, add the asparagus cream to the rice and cook the rice to finish (about 5 minutes). Add the remaining 20 g of butter if the rice is cooked. If the rice is not cooked yet, you can add some more stock.</li>
	<li>Roll up the asparagus tips in the slices of ham.</li>
	<li>Chop a handful of parsley and add half to the risotto and bring it to taste with ground pepper.</li>
	<li>Scoop the risotto onto plates. Put 2 or 3 asparagus-prosciutto roll-ups on each serving. Finally, grate over the Parmigiano and sprinkle over the rest of the chopped parsley.</li>
</ol>
Buon appetito!</p>
