<h4>The South and North Holland provinces, are well known by 
    travelers to the Netherlands. Amsterdam, Utrecht, Leiden and Rotterdam are the usual suspects 
    on their itineraries. Yet these cities are bursting at the seams due to mass tourism, which forces
    locals to move outside of the city centers. If you're looking to pay a more sustainable visit to the Netherlands,
    you're in luck! The Netherlands' under-the-radar regions are a stone's throw from the tourist hubs and
     have so much history, culture and nature to offer!

<h5><a name="#intro">Montferland and Its Landscape</h5>
<p>Montferland is a municipality located in the Achterhoek region, in the east of the Netherlands (Guelders province). 
    It's nestled between the German border and the towns of Didam, Doetinchem, and 's-Heerenberg. 
    In De Achterhoek's Montferland you'll find one of the biggest medieval castles in the Netherlands and
    hilly forests that allow for excellent hiking and cycling, proving that the Netherlands are not that nether!
</p>
<p>The hilly landscape of Montferland was formed during the penultimate ice age (Saale glaciation period). 
    The ridge of hills was formed by a tall glacier pressing down on the soil, 
    which moved upwards on the outer edge of the glacier. A ridge of these type of hills can be found
across the Netherlands and Germany, indicating how far south the ice and glaciers had grown during this glaciation period!</p>

<h5><a name="#castle">Huis Bergh Castle</em></h5>
<p><a href="https://www.huisbergh.nl/en/">Huis Bergh Castle</a> is located in <em>s-Heerenberg</em>, a small town in the hilly Montferland region. The castle
dates back to the early middle ages (1200), although its present form dates back to 1600. It is is one of the 
largest moated castles in the Netherlands and it houses a hotel, a restaurant, and a museum with a world-renowned private late medieval art collection. Visitors can take an audio-guided (EN/DE/NL) tour of the castle, walk through the castle park and enjoy a drink on the terrace
of the castle restaurant. Admission costs €13,50 for adults and €8,50 for minor up to the age of 13 (updated 2020) and tickets
can be purchased online.</p><br>

<h5><a name="#hiking">Hiking & Cycling in Montferland</h5>
The Montferland hills are almost on the doorstep of Huis Bergh Castle. The Bergherbos (named after the castle), is a hilly coniferous
and deciduous forest surrounded by farmland. Wildlife lovers can find badgers, partridges and other birds in the forest. 
The area is a popular hiking, horse riding, wildlife watching and cycling destination among locals and outdoor sports 
enthusiasts alike; it is even the location of an annual international marathon!</p> 

<p>Although Montferland isn't exactly alpine, its climbs will certainly have you break a little sweat, but the views are worth the effort. 
From different viewpoints in the forest, visitors can get a glimpse of the surrounding landscape from an, by Dutch standards, 
unusual perspective. The region is maintained by Dutch nature conservation organization 
<a href="https://www.natuurmonumenten.nl/natuurgebieden/bergherbos"> Natuurmonumenten</a>. There are several routes ranging from 2 to 7 kilometers in length. The routes can be combined to create a longer hike.
In addition, thrill seekers can find a special mountainbiking trail with level differences in the forest. </p>
