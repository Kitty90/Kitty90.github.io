<h4>Salvador is the Afro-Brazilian heart in the state of Bahia and its old Pelourinho center beats with the infectious rhythm of samba drums. Here is where
you'll find rich history in colorful Portuguese colonial buildings, Afro-Brazilian heritage, spicy dishes and religious traditions very distinctive of
the rest of Brazil.</h4>

<h5>Top 3 Colonial and Afro-Brazilian Heritage Experiences in Pelourinho</h5>
<p>Pelourinho is located atop a cliff, above the other neighborhoods of Salvador. On my first walk in Pelourinho I fell in love
with the vibrance of this city and the local outdoor art scene. My night was made when I stumbled upon an outdoor neighborhood samba party; Salvador begs visitors
to submerge themselves in Bahian culture. Dive in and be sure not to miss out on these experiences:</p>

<b>1. Sampling Bahian Cuisine</b><br>
<p>Bahian food is unlike any other regional Brazilian cuisine. 
It has Portuguese, but above all African influences and is my uncontested favorite.
If you're a fan of tropical, caribbean cooking, then you won't be disappointed. Bahian cuisine is rich in seafood, 
coriander, okra, chilis and dendê palm oil. Add to that Bahians' love of deep-frying food and you'll understand that this isn't the healthiest
of diets.</p> 
<p>Many local specialties and delicacies are readily available on the street and sold by Baianas dressed in white. Be sure to try <em>acarajé</em> (deep-fried shrimp and bean balls) with <em>carurú</em> (shrimp and okra paste), 
<em>cocada</em> (sugared coconut sweets), and <em>moqueca</em> (Brazilian curry) with <em>farofa</em> (toasted casava flour); the type with plantains is a must try!</p>

<b>2. Getting Swept Away by Samba</b><br>
<p>Although Samba developed in the <em>favelas</em> (shanty towns) of Rio de Janeiro, its roots lie in Bahian music styles such as the <em>lundu</em> and <em>jongo</em> which
    were brought to Brazil by the enslaved Africans. 
    A Samba procession or performance will be hard to miss in Salvador. In the colonial part of town, Pelourinho, you
    can find several samba schools that are open to visitors. The most famous one, <em>Odolum</em>, starred in Michael Jackon's 'They don't care about us' 
    and plays on Tuesday evenings. There are other schools, such as <em>Clube do Samba</em> that play on the weekends and other weekdays.</p>
</p>
<b>3. Marveling at Colonial Churches and Buildings</b><br>
<p>When coming from the modern urban neighborhoods, entering Pelourinho is like stepping back in time. 
    The cobblestone streets and squares are lined with pastel-colored 17th and 18th century
    colonial Portuguese buildings. Scattered around the neighborhood are brightly colored churches with gold-clad interiors. 
Even if you're not into churches, you should not miss the most impressive and lavishly decorated <em>Igreja de São Francisco</em>. Once you have had your fill of churches, street art and colonial buildings, walk towards <em>Elevador Lacerda</em>.
This elevator was opened in 1872 to take citizens from the higher parts of the city (Pelourinho and Cidade Alta) to the lower parts of town. Down at the waterfront, go souvenir shopping at <em>Mercado Modelo</em>.
However, bear in mind that for safety reasons, it is best to avoid walking back towards Pelourinho via the streets going uphill.</p>

<h5>Getting to Salvador</h5>
<p>Salvador's international airport, Salvador Deputado Luís Eduardo Magalhães, is located 23 kilometers northeast of 
Salvador. There are shuttle bus services, buses and a metro line to and from the airport. However, for safety reasons it is best to 
take a taxi when traveling after nightfall. The city has a direct ferry line to Bom Dispacho, across the bay. Several tour
operators connect the city to other major cities in Brazil.</p>
