<h4>I know, it is almost June, and here I am posting a recipe with parsnip and lentils.  
	It is almost as if I am skipping summer altogether and am entering the realm of autumn recipes. 
	However, I promise, more fresh and minty recipes lie ahead. 
	The thing is, I am soon leaving for a country where they don't really know what an actual winter is, 
	so consider this my farewell to winter.</h4>

<br><p>I will not say farewell to lentils, they intrigue me too much, but this is likely one of the last 
	times I can indulge in the fresh taste of a proper parsnip. I love the taste of parsnip, 
	it's as if an apple, celery and a carrot had a wild together and gave birth to their lovechild, 
	but still no one knows exactly who the father is. Unfortunately, a parsnip needs frost. 
	No, not frosting - the thought only makes me queasy already- I mean freezing as in temperatures 
	dropping below zero (or 32, depending on your location). 
	Otherwise, it won't develop a good flavour.</p>
