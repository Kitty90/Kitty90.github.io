<h4>I had my first encounter with lentils at 18, visiting Lille, France, on a school trip for French class. 
    My French teacher had sent us on a scavenger hunt and it consisted of many French speaking challenges - 
    Best. Lesson. Ever.</h4>

<br><em>Jump to <a href="#recipe">Recipe</a></em><br>
<br><p>One of the challenges required us to swap a typically French item for a typically Dutch item that we 
    had brought with us from the Netherlands. I had brought Advocaat (Dutch type of eggnog), 
    which my mum had been reluctant to part with, but I had promised her to come home with something 
    typically French, and therefore inherently better. At the most wonderful shop that sold French products 
    that  would constitute many a foody's wet dream, I put on my French hat - <em>excusez -moi, mon beret</em>. 
    What followed was a rather embarrassing episode of French-imitating sentences followed by real French quizzical looks. This was a shop; the only trade they were interested in was one that involved money. Yet I persevered, and as you might have guessed, thanks to my best French (or bad negotiation skills?), I managed to come home with lentils, although I had no idea what they were. 

<p>Years later, when I went home to visit my parents, I noticed that the lentils are still sitting on a 
    shelf in the cellar. This shocking discovery left me baffled. Had I honestly been forced to engage in a 
    negotiation with a grumpy French shop owner for nothing?! Why had my mum never used these lentils? 
    Lentils are so healthy and versatile! They are relatively low-carb, packed with minerals and other 
    healthy nutrients and you can use them for stews, soups and salads!</p>

<p>My mum explained, "Lentils are so boring, I never knew what to do with them." 
Now, I love my mum dearly, but that excuse will not do. Sounding like a true know-it-all, I told her, 
"Making them tasty requires some effort, just like obtaining them required some effort." 
So, here it is, a lentil recipe with bold flavours,  
for all those people out there who claim that lentils are boring and bland.</p>

<h5>Recipe: Rustic Lentil Salad</h5>
<br><p><b>Ingredients (serves 2-3)</b>
<ul>
	<li>150 g dry lentils</li>
	<li>1 vegetable stock cube</li>
	<li>1 bay leaf</li>
	<li>two handfuls of fresh spinach or arugula / rocket lettuce</li>
	<li>1/2 red onion</li>
	<li>50 g red grapes</li>
	<li>40 g walnuts</li>
	<li>60 g blue cheese*</li>
	<li>a small handful of parsley leaves</li>
	<li>a pinch of black pepper (to taste)</li>
	<li>a pinch of salt (to taste)</li>
	<li>2 tbsp balsamic vinegar or a red wine vinaigrette ( 2 tbsp extra virgin olive oil, 1 tbsp red wine vinegar, 1 tsp honey)</li>
</ul>
* I used Danablu, but you can use Gorgonzola for a stronger flavour. 
I think Roquefort would be too overpowering. 
If you don't like blue cheese I suggest using goat's or feta cheese for this recipe, 
in which case you could also add some fresh mint for a more Middle Eastern flavour.</p>

<p><b>Method</b>
<ol>
	<li>Put 500 ml of water in a pot and bring to a boil.</li>
	<li>Add the stock cube, bay leaf, and lentils, and bring back to boil. Leave to boil softly with lid on for 20 minutes (taste to check if lentils are cooked, but make sure they do not break).</li>
	<li>Spread the spinach on a plate or put it in a salad bowl.</li>
	<li>Cut the onion in half and then into thin slices.</li>
	<li>Cut the grapes in half as well.</li>
	<li> Put the walnuts on a cutting board and crush them into smaller chunks using the bottom of a plate.</li>
	<li>Once the lentils are cooked, rinse them with cold water and put on top of the spinach.</li>
	<li>Add the red onion, walnuts,  and grapes. Tear chunks off the blue cheese and toss them on top.</li>
	<li>Sprinkle over the parsley, salt, black pepper and balsamic vinegar or vinaigrette (to taste).</li>
