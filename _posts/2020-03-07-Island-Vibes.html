<h4>This post is an ode to the island vibes. We went to a karaoke bar last Friday but were too self-conscious to go on the stage and make a fool out of ourselves, 
even the free shot couldn't entice us. We did, however, enjoy watching others fail miserably at singing their favourite 
songs.</h4>

<p>Nonetheless, our days are not devoid of music and we do sing when inspiration strikes us and the situation calls 
for it. Here are just some of the anthems that, according to us, capture certain Thai situations perfectly.</p>

<li><strong>Put the lime in the coconut</strong>: 
    Any time we're just walking around and I feel chill I start singing this song.</p></li>

<li><p><strong>Ring of Fire</strong> <strong>(Johnny Cash)</strong>: 
    Full disclosure, this started in Bangkok and has come to signify a rather unpleasant visit to the lavatory, 
    brought on by the consumption of a spicy meal the previous day. 
    <em>It burns, burns, burnssss... the ring of fire. </em></p></li>

<li><p><strong>Can't touch this</strong> <strong>(MC Hammer)</strong>: 
    This applies to so many things in Thailand! Monks, monkeys, cats, chillies, jumbles of electricity wires hanging 
    over the sidewalk at shoulder height!</p></li>

<li><p><strong>Banana pancakes (Jack Johnson): </strong>
    We have developed a bit of an addiction to Thai pancakes (<em>Roti</em>). 
    They come with savoury or sweet fillings, but to be honest we've only ever tried the sweet ones since 
    they've kind of become our go-to dessert as they are cheaper than mango with sticky rice.</p></li>
