<h4>Last weekend we went diving with one of the local dive schools, <a href="https://lantadiver.com/" target="_blank">Lanta Diver</a>. 
The boys signed up for their Open Water certificates and I went along for a Refresher course 
(it'd been 5 years since I got my Open Water) and a day of fun diving. 
We used the GoPro to shoot footage underwater, but the pictures that I'm posting 
are from a professional underwater photographer, <a href="http://narcosisnick.com/" target="_blank">Narcosis Nick</a>, 
who was diving with us both days.</h4>

<p>On Saturday we went to the 
<a href="https://www.blueplanetdivers.net/koh-lanta-en/dive-sites-map/ko-bida/" target="_blank">Bida islands</a> 
(Ko Bida Nok, Ko Bida Nai, the two southernmost islets of the Phi Phi islands and 
<a href="https://www.blueplanetdivers.net/koh-lanta-en/dive-sites-map/hin-bida/" target="_blank">Hin Bida</a>, a reef). 
For my refresher I had a private instructor, Corey from Canada, 
a mighty enthusiastic fella with tons of stories and knowledge of the underwater world. 
We went over some essential theory and diving skills on the way out to the dive site and then it was time to gear up 
and dive in (pun intended).</p> 
<p>It was marvelous to be diving again. 
Granted, the water here is a tad murkier than it was when I got my Open Water certificate back in Honduras, 
but the staff told me that the fact that the water is so green is a good sign and it means we'll see plenty of fishes.  
And they were right! I saw clownfishes, angelfishes, nudibranchs (seaslugs - they're adorable), 
moray eels, scorpionfishes, pufferfishes, sea cucumbers, sea urchins, barracudas... ok, so, many fishes... 
BUT ALSO... a hawksbill turtle, casually munching on some bubble coral! 
I was so excited I screamed into my regulator when I saw it! </p>

<p>On Sunday our dive sites were at three islands in the archipelago of 
<a href="https://www.blueplanetdivers.net/koh-lanta-en/dive-sites-map/ko-haa-5-islands/" target="_blank">Ko Haa</a> 
and I went diving with Nadine, a Swiss dive instructor and two other 'fun divers'. At least, that was the plan. 
Divers need to carry weights to be able to actually sink, once underwater they can control their 'buoyancy' 
using their breath (inhaling makes you float, exhaling makes you sink) and if necessary, 
their Buoyancy Control Device (BCD for short; a jacket you wear that you can fill with air from your 
cylinder to create more positive buoyancy if you're carrying too many weights on your weight belt). 
However, if you're not controlling your breathing and you're not carrying enough weights, 
you might not sink even if your BCD is completely deflated. And that's what happened with one of our divers. 
She had enough weights, but struggled to relax when she realized she wasn't sinking so she wasn't breathing correctly and kept on resurfacing. 
When she finally managed to control her buoyancy, she had air for another 9 minutes in her tank. 
So Nadine drew the attention of Corey (who was diving with a student) 
and signalled that he take us with him while she went back to the boat with the unsinkable diver. I had another great dive with Corey, albeit a bit shorter.</p>

<p> The next two dives were with Hugo, a Swedish, 21 year old Dive Master who grew up in Thailand 
and a penchant for little sea critters. 
He asked me what I wanted out of the dives and having seen so many colorful fishes already, 
I told him I wanted to see things that are obscured or look positively alien; the weirder, the better. 
Fortunately, that was Hugo's forte. He showed us flounders and stingrays and, on my final dive with my partner
(who'd just completed his Open Water course on the previous dive), Hugo showed us many (tiny) shrimps, nudibranchs 
and guided us through several caves and tunnels (something I didn't dare do in Honduras).

<p>All in all, we had two excellent days out on the boat and were very pleased with <a href="https://lantadiver.com/" target="_blank">Lanta Diver</a>. 
They'd arranged everything for us: hotel pick-up in the morning, breakfast, lunch, 
snacks and unlimited drinks on the boat and drop-off at the end of the day. 
While you're underwater you don't realize you're exerting yourself, 
but after three dives and a full day on the boat you are completely knackered at the end of the day, so it's very nice to be out
with a dive school that makes sure you're well cared for. </p>

<p>We've been on Koh Lanta for almost 3 weeks now and have another 1,5 weeks to go. 
Whether we get to leave Thailand though, we cannot know. It seems more and more countries are closing their borders 
and since our visas will expire in April, we might be forced to return to Europe.</p>
