<h4>Barcelona is sighing under the weight of mass tourism, but here's a little secret: You don't have to go to Barcelona to marvel at
    Gaudí's architecture. Although the majority of Gaudí's 17 buildings can be found in or around Barcelona, three of them can be found in other parts of Spain and are relatively unknown:
    the Episcopal Palace and Casa Botines in Léon, and the summer chalet El Capricho (the Whim) in Comillas,
    which I fell in love with during my trip through northern Spain. My advice? Travel sustainably, avoid the masses in Barcelona, 
    go off the beaten path and visit this hidden gem in Cantabria.</h4>

<h5><a name="about">About Comillas</h5>
<p>Comillas is a small town on the coast of the northern Spanish province Cantabria. It is part of the Camino del Norte, one of the pilgrim routes
    to Santiago de Compostela. Although the town is relatively small, it has a history of grandeur and enjoys fame in Spain. In the second half of the 19th century the town became a popular 
    summer destination among the Spanish aristocracy after the first Marquess Antonio López y López invited King Alfonso XII
    to his mansion in Comillas.
</p>
<p>Apart from Gaudís Whim, the town has a lot to offer and is deserving of a stroll before or after your visit to El Capricho. It is littered with townhouses 
    commissioned by <em>indianos</em>, rich descendants or returnees from the Americas. Atop a hill above the town you can find
    other architectural gems, such as the Sobrellano Palace and Chapel, and the Universidad Pontifica Comillas.
    The town has several squares, one of which is surrounded by restaurants. They seemed a bit like tourist traps, so perhaps it's best
    to explore the square's side streets if you're feeling peckish and would like a drink with a tapa. The nearby Playa de Oyambre and 
    its natural park are a favorite sights among summer visitors.

<h5><a name="capricho">About El Capricho</h5>
<p><b>Background</b><br>Gaudí's <em>Capricho</em> (Spanish for 'whim') was built in 1883-1885 and commissioned by Máximo Díaz de Quijano, a member of the Spanish gentry who had made 
    his wealth in the Americas. The building was intended to be de Quijano's bachelor pad, but sadly, he never got to enjoy it since he died a year before El Capricho was finished.</p> 
<p><b>The Architecture</b><br>The building is considered characteristic of Gaudí's orientalist period, as it features a minaret-like tower,
    extensive tilework and moorish arches on the interior as well as the exterior. The tiles on El Capricho all have a sunflower-motif, 
    which is symbolic for the building itself. As you may know, sunflowers turn their heads throughout the day, following
    the sun along the horizon to catch all the sunlight. El Capricho does not necessarily turn, but its windows and orientation were chosen with the journey of 
    the sun in mind. In the east, the greenhouse warms up the house in the morning and ventilations mechanisms in the west help keep the house cool. Additional symbolism can be found in the ceilings and the metal
    work of the building; music keys are a reference to the commissioner's love of music.</p>
<p><b>Visiting El Capricho</b><br>Admission to El Capricho costs €5 for adults and €2,50 for minors up to 14 years old. Included in the admission price is a guided tour.
    There is a museum shop on the ground floor of the villa. The museum is open daily, except on bank holidays, from 10:30 AM until at 
    least 17:30, depending on the season. Be sure to check the Museum website to plan your visit. The website is only available in Spanish, but 
    what does that tell you about the likelihood of international tourists knowing about this off-the-beaten-path gem?
