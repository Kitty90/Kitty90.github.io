<h4>Our first week in Koh Lanta has ended, and I have to admit that, since we've casually adjusted to island pace, 
life has slowed down and not that much has happened. We have focused on establishing a routine as it is key to maintaining efficiency and balance. 
One week in, I feel like we've gotten a very pleasant taste of Lanta and its people.</h4>

<h5>How we got to Lanta</h5>
<p>To get to Lanta we flew from Bangkok Don Mueang International Airport to Krabi International Airport with Bangkok Airways.
The flight took about an hour. Once we had landed we used 12GoAsia and found a private minivan that would take us (3 people) 
to Lanta for 1800THB including the ferry fare. </p>

<h5>Establishing a Lanta Routine</h5>
<p>Upon arrival the boys instantly went to the <a href="https://kohub.org/" target="_blank">Kohub</a> to sign up and we went to the 
<a href="https://www.facebook.com/WMfitnessLanta" target="_blank">gym</a> to get information about 
subscriptions. Subscriptions depend heavily on the price, we paid 2000baht for one month, but were happy to have access to a gym again.
On day two we were back in the game, working (out) and trying to figure out how to best plan our days 
(working in the morning vs working in the evening).</p>

<p>We usually have breakfast at our apartment and then go to the gym, together with all the ridiculously fit Swedes 
that seem to have colonized this island. As a result, the prices are also higher than they were in Bangkok and 
Kanchanaburi (mains start at 80THB / €2,30). Truly, sometimes we feel like we're not in Thailand anymore because 
there are white people everywhere and this place runs completely on tourism. </p>

<h5>Lanta People and Culture</h5>
<p>The local population offers an interesting mix of cultures though: it consists of <em>sea gypsies</em>, 
muslims and Chinese. The sea gypsies, although originally nomadic, are said to have been the first settlers on the island. 
They arrived 500 years ago from Indonesia and Malaysia and settled on the east coast in Lanta Old Town, 
protected from the open ocean. We haven't visited the sea gypsy villages yet, 
but from what we've heard they're quite different from the rest of the island. 
People live in stilt houses, (used to) practice animist beliefs and their society is matriarchal. 
Allegedly, sea gypsy culture is sheltered from outside influence as tourism 
has not taken over the east coast of the island (but honestly, that seems like a bit of a white lie to attract tourists). </p>

<p>The second ethnic group are the muslims, who also arrived from Malaysia. 
It's quite funny to see half-naked tourists go around an island where some of the local men wear djellabas 
and most muslim women don the hijab or even niqaab. No one seems to care though, 
which is hard for me to fathom as the only other muslim country I've travelled to was 
<a href="https://www.filteredsnippets.com/categories.html#morocco">Morocco</a> 
where showing skin was very much frowned upon by the locals.</p>

<p>The people here are incredibly warm and welcoming, more than in the north. 
There are a few little gems of cheap eateries where we have become daily regulars and people recognize and greet us. 
Interestingly, most of these places are run by muslims and they are not frequented by tourists 
(I wonder if subconscious racism among tourists has something to do with that). 
These restaurants serve halal food and cater mostly to the local muslim population on the island for local prices 
(mains for  50THB / €1,60). </p>

<p>The last ethnic group consists of Thai-Chinese who moved here 100 years ago to flee the rise of Chinese communism. 
Frankly I haven't seen any - perhaps the rest of the island decided to lock them up somewhere because of Corona? 
That would explain why we don't notice any of the corona madness here; people don't wear masks and life goes on uninterrupted. </p>
