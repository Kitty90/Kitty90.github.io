<h4>This isn't a joke, you read the headline correctly! You don't need to book an expensive ticket 
    to the tropics to see exotic wildlife. In Zwillbrocker Venn, right across the border from the Dutch province of Gelderland,
    you can spot flamingos in the wild.

<h5>About Zwillbrock, Zwillbrocker Venn and its Routes</h5>
<p>Zwillbrocker Venn is a fenn that developed in a former peat digging area. The protected nature reserve is 157 hectares and is completely closed off from traffic. 
Visitors can only enter on foot or bicycle. There are several circular routes at Zwillbrocker Venn; the shortest
and main route is 5.2 kilometers and circles the fenn. The route connects to other larger routes and there are several
starting points.</p>
<p>Make a quick stop in Zwillbrock itself before or after visiting the park. 
    Outside of the park, in the center of Zwillbrock, you can find a bakery that 
    sells freshly baked buns and coffee, right across
    from the charming baroque church.</p>  

<h5>Flora and Fauna in Zwillbrocker Venn</h5>
Along the well-indicated routes in Zwillbrocker Venn you will find many information boards 
describing the park's flora and fauna. The fenn consists of forest- and swampland and encircles large pools that are home to many birds. 
Zwillbrocker Venn is famous for its flamingo colony, which comes to nest in the reserve every spring. In recent years,
however, concerns have been raised about the drought in the area. Flamingos favor wet areas, so long dryspells might cause
 the flamingos to stay away.</p>
 <p>The flamingos share their nesting territory with black-headed gulls. 
    Other noteworthy species can be seen in the area are otters, scottish highland cows, and
    various wild geese and duck species.

<h5>How to get to Zwillbrocker Venn</h5>
<p>Zwillbrocker Venn is located on the German-Dutch border, west of the German town of Vreden and east of
    the Dutch town of Groenlo. It is sort of in the middle of nowhere and cannot be reached by public transport.
However, it would make a nice stop on a larger trekking route on foot or by bike.
The main starting point of the routes is at Hotel Kloppendiek in Zwillbrock.</p>
