<h5>For our first weekend we decided to spend our Saturday doing absolutely nothing as we realized 
that we hadn't had a chill day of lazying about since our arirval in Thailand. </h4>

<p>On Sunday, however, it was time for Kitty's Adventures on a Scooter, the sequel, despite the Kanchanaburi episode. 
This island isn't easy to get around and there are so many places to see outside town, 
that I had come to the conclusion that I had to get over my fear of being on a scooter. 
It also seemed reasonable, because traffic, like everything else here, goes at a don't-worry-be-happy island pace, 
with the only added challenge being that you have to look out for crossing monkeys. 
So, we rented a scooter here at the hotel and took it to a back street for some much-needed 'training'. 
After half an hour of 'It's swirling too much!', 'Not so fast!' and 'Not so close to the edge!' 
I was able to be on the back of the scooter and keep my mouth shut. Ok, I admit, 
I later found out while driving that I really dislike going down steep hills ('Slow down! Slow down!'), 
but what can I say? I'm Dutch, I was made for flat terrain. </p>

<p>We took a beautiful coastal road to the southernmost point of the island, 
where Mu Ko Lanta National Park is located. After cooling down with a fruit shake at the park's 
restautant we set off on the park's 2 kilometer nature trail through the hills. 
Very close to the head of the trail we encountered huge monitor lizards, 
crab-eating macaques and dusky leaf monkeys. During the hike we didn't see much wildlife, 
although at one point I saw a flying dragon lizard gliding from one tree to another right in front of me. 
Despite not seeing many animals, we enjoyed hiking the cool and shaded trail. 
We made several stops along the way, where we sat down and listened to the cacophony of sounds 
and the rustling of leaves as animals were moving through the canopy. </p>

<p>We beach bummed for a bit after the hike and then decided to try to get home before nightfall. 
We had a beautiful ride home along the coast as the sun set. We made one final stop along the way 
to arrange everything for our next adventure: diving! 
The boys signed up for the PADI Open Water course which starts tomorrow and I'll do a Refresher course on Saturday. 
Super excited!</p>
