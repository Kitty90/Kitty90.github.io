<h4>Lanta is an island that begs to be explored on scooter. Although the majority of visitors to this Thai paradise 
stay on the western coast and in the conglomeration of resorts in Ban Saladan, the corners of this tropical island merit exploration.
We rented a scooter and drove down to the southernmost tip of the island to visit Mu Ko Lanta National Park.</h4>

<h5>Exploring Koh Lanta on Scooter</h5>
<p>Koh Lanta isn't easy to get around and there are so many places to see outside town, 
that renting a scooter for the duration of your stay is a sensible thing to do. Even novice scooter drivers 
are likely to feel comfortable scootering around the island, because traffic, like everything else here, 
goes at a don't-worry-be-happy island pace, with the only added challenge being that you have to look out for crossing monkeys. 
There are plenty of scooter places in the towns.</p>

<p>Mu Ko Lanta is easy to reach; drivers simply need to stick to the coastal road going south. The route is beautiful; you'll be swirling through the hills, with villages or jungle on your left and the ocean to the right. 
Driving back north at sunset with the sky turning shades of pink and orange above the ocean is bound to make your heart flutter. 
Do keep in mind that the road can be bumpy, hilly or have potholes and when playing your day consider calculating in some extra time since you'll want to stop at viewpoints and beaches
along the way.</p>

<h5>Mu Ko Lanta National Park</h5>
<p>Entry to the Park costs 200THB p.p. and gives you access to the beach, restaurant and hiking trail. 
After cooling down with a fruit shake at the park's restaurant we set off on the 2 kilometer nature trail through the hills.</p> 
Very close to the head of the trail you can encounter huge monitor lizards, 
crab-eating macaques and dusky leaf monkeys. During the hike we didn't see much wildlife, 
although at one point I saw a flying dragon lizard gliding from one tree to another right in front of me. 
Even if you do not get to see many animals, the shaded trail is very enjoyable.  
Take your time and make several stops along the way to sit down and listen to the cacophony of sounds 
and the rustling of leaves as animals move through the canopy. </p>

<p>Afterwards, the beach in the park allows for some well-deserved beachbumming. Ride back north
along the coast just before sunset for some amazing views. </p>
