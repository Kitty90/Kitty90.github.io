<h4>Every year, Spain's eastern and southern costas are jam-packed with national and international tourists. The northern provinces, however, 
    boast dramatic coastlines and beaches that are conveniently less crowded. Off-season travel guarantees almost
    private beaches and coastal hiking in pristine nature, as we experienced on the Costa Quebrada - a geological wonder
     just a stone's throw from Santander.

<h5>About the Costa Quebrada</h5>
<b>Geological History</b><br>
<p>With its rugged coastline consisting of dramatic cliffs, ragged rocks jutting up from the sea and a cracked ocean floor that is exposed at low tide, the Costa Quebrada
    truly is a geological marvel. Although I am not a geologist, I will try to explain what I have learned about the geological history of the otherworldly landsacpe on this coast.
    The cliffs and rocks consists of different sediments or <em>strata</em>. Tectonic forces, specifically the collision between the African and European plates
    pushed the strata vertically upwards, creating a fold. We can still see this today, because the exposed rocks have vertical instead of horizontal strata lines.</p> 
    
<p>However, the unusual composition of strata wasn't always visible. During the Ice Age, the sediments were hidden; the seawater was locked in the ice caps so the sea level 
    was low. There used to be a coastal plain where we can now see the ocean. The coastline and the rocks as we see them today were shaped and exposed after the last ice age. 
    When the ice melted, sea levels rose and the tidal movement of the water eroded the rocks of the coastal plain.</p> 
    
<b>Conservation</b><br>
<p>The area has been damaged by oil spills in the past. Fortunately, it is now recognized as a geological park and
    maintained by conservation and education organization <a href="https://parquegeologicocostaquebrada.com/en/">Costa Quebrada</a>. They organize night safari tours, have developed auto-tour guides and 
    have placed many signs along the coast to explain the origin of this dramatic, almost alien landscape.</p>

<h5><a name="route">Suggested Hiking Route</h5>
<p>We hiked a linear route from Playa de Covachos to Playa del Madero and back. The hike was about 10 kilometers (6.2 miles) in total. Alternatively, you
    can also hike five kilometers one way and take the bus back to Soto de la Marina or Santander in Liencres.
    The majority of the route is directly on the coast or cliffs, although at times you do have to make a little detour through the 
    some villages on the coast. Park in Santa Cruz de Bezana and walk down Calle de la Arnía to find the dirt path that will take you
    along the following six beaches: 
<ul>
    <li><b>Playa de Covachos</b></li>
    <p>Playa de Covachos is a cove, the cliff around the beach seems to almost hang over the beach. At low tide the nearby rock is connected
        to the mainland.</p>

</div>
    <br><li><b>Playa de la Arnía</b></li>
    <p>Playa de la Arnía is by far the most impressive, perhaps even mind-boggling beach along this route. Although the beach itself is a sand beach surrounded by high rocks,
        the true sight is behind the ridge at the back of the beach. Here you'll find a beach that changes dramatically at low tide, when the 
        water recedes and exposes the cragged sea floor. The high cliffs surrounding the beach offer a great view and help you appreciate
    and understand the geological force that shaped the landscape.</p>

    <br><li><b>Playa de Portío & Playa de Cerrías</b></li>
    <p>Playa de Portío and Playa de Cerrías are right across from one another. Portío faces west, and Cerrías faces east. There is a path along the coast between the two beaches,
        but it might be overgrown. We couldn't find it on the way towards Playa del Madero and walked through Barrio Portío and Barrio Cerreas from
        Playa de Portío to Playa de Cerrías.

    <br><li><b>Playa Somocuevas (nudist beach)</b></li>
    <p>Playa Somocuevas is a nudist beach, but it is very secluded. If nudity makes you uncomfortable, you can simply
        stick to the route as the beach is so far from the path that you won't see any nudist sunbathers; the path is on the cliff 
        and to reach the beach you'd have to walk all the way down. Since I didn't want to be that person who takes pictures of a nudist beach, 
    I can only suggest you go here yourself to get an impression!</p>

    <li><b>Playa del Madero</b></li> 
    <p>Our final stop was at Playa del Madero. There is a marker here to indicate you have reached the highest point in the region. The cliffs
        above Playa del Madero are a great place to sit and have a rest. The views of the ocean are breath-taking and on a clear day
        you can see the majestic (snow-capped) Picos de Europa in the neighboring province of Asturias.

<h5><a name="travelinfo">How to Get to the Costa Quebrada</h5>
    <p>The Costa Quebrada is a stretch of coast directly northwest of the Cantabrian capital Santander. There are several bus lines that
        run between the towns on the Costa and Santander. Check the ALSA website for up-to-date travel information. 
        A one-way ride to Liencres, the farthest and western-most town on the hike, is 37 minutes. Parking in Santa Cruz de Bezana
         is relatively difficult, especially in high season.
