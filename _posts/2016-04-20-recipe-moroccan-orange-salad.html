<h4>When traveling to Morocco a couple of years ago, I had big plans to feast on the local dishes. 
    However, I was visiting during the holy month of Ramadan, a time of fasting for Muslims, 
    which meant that food and drink were scarcely available between sunrise and sunset. 
    Oh, and I had made the wise decision to plan my Moroccan holiday in the middle of summer, 
    when the weather easily reaches temperatures over 40 degrees (104F) during the day. 
    Yes, I was in for a treat alright.</h4>
<br><p><em>Jump to <a href="#recipe">recipe</a></em>.</p>

<p>Out of respect for the local culture, I tried to conform to the meal times, 
    although I allowed myself to drink water out of sight, in small alleys - 
    but even there I wasn't always safe from disapproving looks. 
    Naturally, I'd be absolutely famished at the end of the day, but I don't believe that 
    this should be considered to be the cause of my love for Moroccan cuisine. 
    In my opinion, anyone with functioning taste buds and a slightly developed palate, 
    would go ga-ga over Morocco's fragrant tagines with tender lamb, which are perfect blends of sweet, 
    spicy and fresh. A walk around the cities' old medinas is a culinary experience in and of itself; 
    spice merchants are proudly presenting towers of spices, and hassling you to buy their spice 
    mix Ras el Hanout (top of the shop), all of them claiming that their Ras-el-Hanout is not just 
    the top of the shop, but the best in the city.</p>

<p>I never found out who sold the best spice mix in Morocco, but ever since I've visited I have been
     crazy about the combination of spices that are used in Moroccan recipes. 
     This recipe is one of my favourites and my friends have - I dare say gladly - been served this salad 
     many times and it always sparks comments. It has the freshness of the mint and orange, 
     the sweetness of the dates and spiciness of the cinnamon and a nice depth and crunch from the almonds - 
     I love it.</p>

<p>A few weeks ago I served it at a birthday party, as I knew some of the guests had probably never 
    had it before - I admit, I try to use it whenever I can. The response I got this time? 
    "This is so different, I've never had anything like it!" Is that good or bad? 
    I'd say try this recipe and decide for yourself - 
    but I think I've got a hunch of what your conclusion might be.</p>

<h5><a name="recipe">Recipe: Moroccan Orange Salad</h5>
<br><p><b>Ingredients (serves 4 as a side dish)</b>
<ul>
	<li>6 navel oranges</li>
	<li>bunch of mint</li>
	<li>handful of almonds (80 g)</li>
	<li>ground cinnamon or 1/4 tsp Ras el Hanout</li>
	<li> 8 - 10 large medjool dates</li>
	<li>( 2 tbsp orange blossom water)</li>
</ul></p>
<p><b>Method</b>
<ol>
	<li>Cut the top and bottom of the oranges, exposing the orange flesh.</li>
	<li>Put the orange on its bottom. Remove the white skin and peel* from the orange, cutting slices of peel from the top down to the bottom (see picture below).</li>
	<li>Once you have peeled and removed the white skin from the oranges, cut the oranges into wedges along the membrane of the wedges (see picture below). You can just tear the oranges into wedges, but cutting out the wedges without the membranes will give you a sweeter taste and it gives an extra orange glow and gloss to the fruit.</li>
	<li>Arrange the orange slices in a circle on a plate and sprinkle some ground cinnamon on top.</li>
	<li>Roughly chop the dates and almonds and sprinkle on top.</li>
	<li>Take about 8 big mint leaves, stack them and roll them up. Cut the roll into thin slivers of mint and sprinkle on top of the salad.</li>
	<li>Sprinkle over the orange blossom water.</li>
</ol>
* If you don't want to throw away the orange peels, try making candied orange peels with a bit of water and 
sugar. I will post a recipe shortly.</p>
