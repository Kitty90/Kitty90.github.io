<h4>In times of social uncertainty it is difficult to look ahead, and now, during the COVID-19 pandemic perhaps even more so because 
    the end of these strange times is not in sight. Politicians and market watchers, however, have started to contemplate and speculate about 
    the repercussions of imposed lockdowns. The common reflection? We need to get economic growth, measured in GDP (Gross Domestic Product) back 
    to its pre-corona level, ASAP. But what was the role of growth in creating the mess we are in? And is GDP really an adequate measure of the 
    state and welfare of society?</h4> 
<br><p>In Doughnut Economics, Oxford Economist Kate Raworth inspects the growth narrative that 
    forms the foundation of our economy, shakes it to its core and reveals it is nothing 
    but quicksand supporting a house of cards that requires a delicate balance. A must-read for anyone interested in building an alternative, 
    better society, even if you have no have no background in economics.</p>

<blockquote>Economics is broken. It has failed to predict, let alone prevent, finacial crises that have shaken the foundations of our 
        societies. Its outdated theories have permitted a world in which extreme poverty persists while the wealth of the super-rich grows 
        year on year. And its blind spots have led to policies that are degrading the living world on a scale that threatens all of our futures.

<p>So reads the dramatic back cover of Doughnut Economics. However, all is not lost as Raworth illustrates the seven ways in which the economic
        system is failing us, but more importantly, how we can fix it.</p>

<p>The economics professor starts off by taking the reader by the hand, teaching a general economics 101 crash course, discussing key insights, theories, and developments in economic 
    science and history that formed the bedrock of our modern market economy. She illustrates that, contrary to what it was expected to 
    deliver, the growth economy has caused greater disparities between rich and poor and is causing environmental, and subsequently social 
    and economic problems. In short, Raworth shows how economic development negatively affects society and the environment.</p>
<p>She continues to expose the flaws in this mechanism and proposes a new, more equitable economic framework. Her solution? A doughnut model 
    of the economy, its ring representing a safe operating space for humanity, in which interactions between the environment, the economy 
    and social welfare are balanced to ensure none of them are too negatively affected by the development of the other. Central to working 
    with the doughnut model, is changing your mindset, so Raworth proposes 7 steps to help you think like a 21st century economist in seven 
    simple steps, here are the key takeaways:</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Change the Goal</b>: We should focus on creating a balanced society in which humanity as well as the eocnomy and the environment 
    can thrive, rather than growing the economy and exhausting resources, which breeds inequality and harms ecosystems.</li>
<li><b>See the Big Picture</b>: To understand the global macroeconomy, we need to see the big picture of the whole system and its 
    actors. This means not only the economy, but society and (environmental) resources and ecosystems need to be included in economic models.</li>
<li><b>Nurture human nature</b>: Humans are social creatures that have been led to believe they are greedy. People should be encouraged to 
    care for nature and society..</li>
<li><b>Get Savvy with Systems</b>: We need to understand how actors in the big picture (ecosystems, the economy, society, resources) 
    interact, so we can bring the entire system in balance.</li>
<li><b>Design to Distribute</b>: Neoliberalism breeds inequality. To overcome inequality, wealth, not only income, needs to be redistributed. 
    This will allow humans to lead a life with dignity, possibilities and community.</li>
<li><b>Create to Regenerate</b>: Social power rather than economic growth safeguards the environment. 
    Business and governments should be generous to the environment and society in their practices. 
    They should adopt a sense of bio-stewardship and social responsibility.</li>
<li><b>Be Agnostic about Growth</b>: GDP should no longer be the measure of economic success and foundation of economic policy. 
    Economies need to be redesigned regardless of whether GDP is increasing. This requires a restructuring of financial, political and 
    social expectations.</li> 
</ul></p>
<p>Raworthâ€™s writing is witty, full of insightful anecdotes and clever metaphors and analogies, making its socially critical content accessible to laymen and 
    novice economists. Moreover, by providing seven simple steps to change the current market economy she not only critiques current society, 
    but also helps you see the silver lining: we can turn this around and create a balanced world in which humanity, the economy and the 
    environment all thrive.</p>
