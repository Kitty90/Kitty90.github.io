<h4>Castro Urdiales is a charming seafront town in the Spanish province Cantabria. 
The spa town is frequented by sun lovers and Compostela pilgrims alike. 
Its gothic church, dramatically perched on a rock overlooking the harbor, 
as well as its medieval center, beckon visitors to stop by and wander around. 
Castro Urdiales was the first stop on our trip through northern Spain, 
which we kicked off having cavities for breakfast at a cafe that looks as sweet as its cakes taste.</h4>

<h5>Sights to Explore in Castro Urdiales</h5>
<p>Castro Urdiales is a small village that lends itself perfectly to being epxlored on foot. The three main sights 
(Santa María church, Santa Ana Castle and Puente Romano) are all situated on the harbor front, in close proximity of one another.
A morning or afternoon stroll should allow you to explore the highlights and the medieval center and leave you with enough time to sit down and
enjoy a coffee break or soak up the sun.</p>

<b>1. Iglesia de Santa María de la Asunción</b>
<p>Visitors to Castro Urdiales can't miss the gothic church sitting atop of a rock and overlooking the harbor.
The medieval Santa María church was built in the 13th century, but additions were made until the 19th century. 
Entry to the church is free, but donations are welcome. This spot is also a great starting point for a stroll through the town, as there is 
an underground parking garage.</p>

<b>2. Santa Ana Castle</b><br>
<p>The castle, a stone's throw from the Santa María church, is one of the few remaining medieval castles in this region of Spain.
The structure dates back to the 12th century and is built in a military style, as it served as a defence post. Additions were made to the castle,
the most striking one being the lighthouse that was built in 1853.</p> 

<b>3. Puente Romano</b><br>
<p>The bridge leading up to Santa Ana castle and the church is called the Roman Bridge by locals. 
Contrary to what its name suggests, the structure isn't Roman; it dates back to medieval times and was 
constructed to provide access to the church and castle. The bridge overlooks a pool where the waves crash and break on the rocks and brave locals go swimming.
This part of the town offers a great view of Castro Urdiales and its harbor. Take a good look before continuing your stroll towards the town center.</p>

<b>4. Castro Urdiales' Medieval Town Center and Boulevard</b><br>
<p>Once you have visited the main sights, walk back towards the town's center. The Plaza del Ayuntamiento, or central town square,
    serves as a nice entry point for exploring the town's small streets and alleys with souvenir and delicacy shops. Then, walk along the Paseo
    Marítimo and stop to admire the façades on the seafront townhouses in Spanish art nouveau style. Continue to the Plaza de los Jardines and Plaza de la Barrera. 
    At the end of this stroll, you will find yourself close to the quaint coffee and cake shop <a href="https://www.mandarinagarden.es/cafeteria-relax-peques-castrourdiales.html">Mandarina Garden</a>.</p>

<h5><a name="coffeebreak">Coffee Break at <a href="https://www.mandarinagarden.es/cafeteria-relax-peques-castrourdiales.html">Mandarina Garden</a>: A Sweet Tooth's Dream</h5>
<p>Before or after setting off on your stroll, allow yourself to splurge a little and go to <a href="https://www.mandarinagarden.es/cafeteria-relax-peques-castrourdiales.html">Mandarina Garden</a>. 
This cotton candy colored cafe offers breakfast and brunch, but most importantly, vibrantly and abdundantly decorated cakes. 
Portion sizes are generous; we ordered a slice of Dulce de leche
cake and lemon meringue pie in the morning and had a very small late lunch that afternoon. </p>
