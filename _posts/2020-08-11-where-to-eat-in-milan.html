<h4>When coming to Italy, you know you can expect to eat like a king. The standards are so high that what may seem eating like a king to foreigners is deemed eating like a commoner by the locals. However, in major cities it is easy to fall for the tourist traps close to the main sights. In this post I list the best food experiences we had on our two-day trip to Milan.</h4>

<h5> Where to Eat in Milan</h5>
<p>On our culinary exploration we aimed to sample both Milanese dishes as well as Italian classics. Some were hits, others not so much. Here 
    are the culinary highlights of our trip:
    <ul>
        <li><b>Life-changing Pizza at Lievità Varese</b></li>
We arrived late in the evening by train and had planned to go to il Pescetto which came recommended by an Italian friend. 
Unfortunately, by 9.30 PM this fish restaurant was not only full, but people were queuing up to get a table. 
We were famished and walked down the street to Lievità Varese. 
We decided to share a pizza and a side dish. We ordered a “Pizza Brontese”, since reading its toppings immediately made my 
mouth water:  Sicilian pistachio pesto, Agerolan fior di latte (mozzarella made from cow milk), lemon zest, parmigiano cheese 
and olive oil. Strange, but with the potential to be lifechanging! For the side dish we decided to go for the Burrata with 
anchovies, sundried tomatoes and basil. 
Doughy, foldable crust, zesty fresh lemon taste and pistachio: why had we not thought about putting this on a pizza before? 
The burrata was perfectly creamy and tasty, but I was kind of disappointed we had decided to go for one pizza and that I could 
not eat the whole pizza by myself.<br><br> 
        <li><b>Focaccia snack behind the Duomo</b></li>
Yes, that's the best description I could come up with as I have forgotten the name of this place and it doesn't show up on Google Maps.
Next to the Gutteridge shop behind the Duomo, there’s a little hole in the wall that sells extravagant focacce to go. 
After spending the morning hiking up the Duomo and visiting the San Bernardino alle Osse sanctuary, it was high time for our 
mid-morning snack. We ordered one focaccia with black truffle cream, pistachio mortadella, rocket salad and mozzarella as these 
babies are big enough to share. We continued our walk to the Galleria Vittorio Emanuele practically making love to our sandwiches, 
praising it every 2 meters, although the delicious truffle cream overpowered the pistachio a little bit.<br>

        <li><b>Milanese Signature Dishes at La Cotoletta</b></li>
Although the traditional interior may make you think you’ve entered an Italian restaurant in the 80s, don’t let that fool you. 
This charming little restaurant is famous for serving two dishes: risotto Milanese (saffron risotto) and cotoletta Milanese 
(breaded veal cutlet). Risotto Milanese is a signature dish of Milan. A bright golden, rich and perfectly buttery, a good saffron 
risotto is a must-eat in Milan. Avoid the tourist traps where saffron is only used sparingly. La Cotoletta serves the real deal. 
We ordered a cotoletta siciliana; a cutlet with olive, tomato sauce, anchovies and cheese on top and the risotto Milanese as a 
side dish. Since we love a good pasta carbonara we decided to get a plate of that as well and share everything. 
The cutlet and pasta were delicious, but the risotto was so rich and refined it was divine.<br>

        <li><b>Best Gelati at Pasticceria Sant Ambroeus</b></li>
Coming to Milan in summer means coming in low season: the Milanese have fled to the lakes in the north and the tourists 
avoid the city's sweldering heat. We benefited greatly from the lack of crowds and queues for attractions and attempted not to 
overheat by indulging in copious amounts of gelati. The best gelati we had in Milan was at Pasticceria San Ambroeus, 
close to Babila metro station. We were a little bit scared it was going to be pricey, because the place looks fancy and you have 
to pay before you’re escorted to the ice cream station. The portions were lavish and the Maggiolina, yoghurt, pistachio, 
and fig and mascarpone ice cream were superb.<br>

        <li><b>Aperitivo at La Prosciutteria</b></li>
Did you know Milan is basically built on a swamp and used to look more like Venice? Navigli in the southwest is the neighborhood 
in Milan where you can still find canals, but more importantly, aperitivo. Milan had many more canals before, as they were 
constructed to transport goods from nearby lakes to the city. The marble for the Duomo, for example, was shipped in and da Vinci 
is said to have been involved in the renovation of the canals.

Now, this scenic little corner of the city is better known for its design and arts vibe and aperitivo culture as people come here 
after work for a drink and a bite before dinner.
And aperitivo was had on our final evening! Not a very Milanese one though, as La Prosciutteria is Tuscan, but nevertheless it was 
a true treat.

Get an aperitivo board for two to sample mouthwateringly good cheeses and cold cuts, such as (smoked / cooked / regular dried) 
prosciutto and finocchiona (fennel salami). It comes with fruits, a grilled vegetable salad, airy rustic bread and a range of 
interesting Italian spreads: deep-flavored chestnut honey, pine nut marmalade, truffle cream and forest fruit jam. 

Although aperitivo is supposed to be had before dinner, this spread was so abundant we skipped dinner.</ul></p>

Italy has a top-notch railway system; most major cities are very well connected by high-speed rail,
