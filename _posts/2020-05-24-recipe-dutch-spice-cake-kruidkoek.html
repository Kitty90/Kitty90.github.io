<h4>Kruidkoek or <em>ontbijtkoek</em> is a very traditional Dutch cake. When I was young, my mom used to bake something special on Sundays.
     Her kruidkoek was one of my favorites and this is my adaptation of hers. The traditional recipe calls for milk and special Dutch 
    ingredients such as koek- en speculaaskruiden (Dutch spice blend) and Dutch basterdsuiker 
    (made with sugar, sugar syrup, and caramel or molasses), but these can easily be replaced with other spice blends, 
    demarara sugar and almond milk.

<p>In the Netherlands koek- and speculaaskruiden is a common spice blend for baking, especially for winter cookies
    (speculaas, pepernoten). Note that it is different from Belgian <em>speculoos</em>, which is not a spice blend, but 
    a cookie made with molasses / caramelized sugar. Specu<em>loos</em> actually means the cookie is spice<em>less</em>. 
    Speculoos was created in Belgium in the early 20th century because the traditional speculaas spices were very expensive in Belgium; unlike the Netherlands Belgium didn't have
    easy access to spices via its colonies in the East Indies.</p>
<p>It's interesting that countries all have different spice blends for baking. Here are some varieties, and their ingredients. 
    They might be somewhat different, but all can be used for kruidkoek if you don't have speculaaskruiden.
<ul>
    <li><b>Dutch speculaaskruiden:</b> nutmeg, cinnamon, aniseed, coriander seed, cardamom, clove, ginger, white pepper</li>
    <li><b>British mixed spice:</b> cinnamon, allspice, nutmeg, cloves, ginger, coriander seed, mace</li>
    <li><b>German gingerbread (Lebkuchen) spice:</b>cinnamon, allspice, nutmeg, cloves, ginger, coriander seed, mace, cardamom, star anise</li>
    <li><b>Swedish gingersnap (pepparkakor) blend:</b> cinnamon, cloves, ginger, cardamom</li>
    <li><b>American pumpkin pie spice:</b> cinnamon, nutmeg, ginger, cloves, allspice</li>
