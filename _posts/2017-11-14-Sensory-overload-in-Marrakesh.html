<h4>In 2011 I traveled to Marrakesh for the first time and it left me with an ambivalent impression of the city. I returned to Marrakesh on my second trip to <a href="">Morocco</a> and I have to admit, I will always have a love-hate relationship with this place.</h4>

<p>Marrakesh is a tantalizing feast for the senses, yet in my experience, it can also be overwhelming and tilt from warm and mesmerizing to inhospitable and crude. Like a toxic lover whose moodswings give you whiplash and you cannot have a future with, I believe Marrakesh is best enjoyed as a brief fling, and even if you come out unscathed it will still leave you feeling like you just got out of a whirlwind love affair. Enjoy at your own peril, a breakup may be inevitable, but you will always be hungry for more.</p>
<p>Marrakesh has historically been a melting pot and an adventure into the unknown. Located at the foot of the Atlas mountains, it long served as a trading post and harbor for trade caravans and travellers from the mountains and the Sahara desert. The <i>medina</i> or old city, seems to wrap itself around Djemaa el Fna square, the centre of all the activity and gathering place for snakecharmers, storytellers and food vendors alike. Encircling the square are dizzyingly maze-like souks and narrow alleys boasting lavish <i>riads</i> whose courtyards provide a welcome relief from all the hustle and bustle.</p>

<p>Arriving in Marrakesh is submerging yourself in Morocco. Once you get out of the taxi from the airport and start walking towards Djemaa-el-Fna square you are entering a warzone for the senses. Spice shops (wow), food stalls (oh!), tanneries(yuck!), touts and vendors (argh!) are all vying for your attention. Before you know it they lure you in and you'll find yourself overpaying for a henna tattoo you didn't know you wanted. Now is the time to wind down, to gather your bearings, go to one of the rooftop terraces that line the square and souks, overpay for your drink and have a breather while you figure out how you're going to brave this city.</p>

<h5>Sights you shouldn't miss in Marrakesh:</h5>
<li><b>Djemaa-el-Fna square</b></li>

<p>The square is open during the day, but really comes to life at night with food stalls, snake charmers, henna artists, storytellers. Have dinner here one night and save yourself the hassle of figuring out which stall is the cheapest: prices are the same at all stalls.</p>
    
<li><b>The medina</b></li>

</div>
<p>Get lost in the maze of souks, each area having its own specialty: spice shops, leather and clothing workshops. If you think your nose can handle it, visit a tannery but be prepared to have to haggle with and pay for a guide. If you're going to <a href="">Fez</a> as well I suggest going to a tannery there as the ones in Marrakesh are less impressive.</p>

<li><b>Bahia Palace</b></li>

<p>The Bahia Palace was built in the late 19th century. The palace contains beautiful architectural elements, such as intricate woodwork and woodinlay ceilings, mosaics, plaster and stucco works. The palace grounds also encompass several courtyards and gardens.</p>
      
<li><b>Saadian Tombs</b></li>

</div>
<p>The Saadian Tombs are a royal necropolis. The Tombs contain the remains of members of Saadian dynasty that ruled Morocco in the 16th and 17th century. The necropolis is known for its decoration, consisting of mosaics and intricate plaster work.</p>
    
<li><b>El Badi Palace (if you have extra time and imagination)</b></li>

</div>
<p>El Badi Palace was built in 1593 by the Saadian Sultan Ahmed al-Mansour to commemorate the victory over the Portuguese. The palace, now a ruin, encircles an enormous patio and is said to have comprised more than 300 rooms decorated in gold, turquoise and crystal. None of that splendor survived, however, as the palace was stripped and fell into ruin when the capital of Morocco was moved from Marrakesh to Meknes in the 17th century. Still, it is a nice place to visit if you have a little imagination and would like to have nice views of the city from the palace walls.</p>
