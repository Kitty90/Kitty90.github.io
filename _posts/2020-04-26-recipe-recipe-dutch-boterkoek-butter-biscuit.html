<h4>On April 27 the Dutch celebrate King's Day and what better way to honor this occasion than with a Dutch recipe?
	Does the Netherlands have a culinary tradition? Well, yes, but people generally don't speak very favourably of it,
 considering that our most famous national dish is mashed potatoes mixed with kale and a sausage on the side. 
 I guess you now understand my inevitable urge to explore other countries' culinary traditions.</h4>

<br><p>However, there is one thing the Dutch are rather good at when it comes to food: biscuits, or, 
for all the Americans, cookies - a word that is actually derived from the Dutch 'koekje'. 
As a Dutchie, I am rather proud of this recipe. It is quite similar to the Scottish shortbread, 
but I would say the Dutch variety is moister than its Scottish cousin.</p>

<p>This biscuit is often served at tea time, or coffee time, as most Dutch people drink coffee - and lots of it, 
I might add. Growing up, my days were not only scheduled around meal times (7 AM, 1 PM and 6 PM), 
but also coffee times (10-11 AM, 3-4 PM and 8-9 PM). And it's not just coffee time, oh no! As the family sat down for coffee, 
My father would always ask my mum, "Are we also having something to go with the coffee?" 
This biscuit used to be one of my favourites as a little girl and whenever 
I'm baking it, the smell always reminds me of coffee time and Sunday mornings back home. 
I hope you enjoy it as much as I do!</p>
