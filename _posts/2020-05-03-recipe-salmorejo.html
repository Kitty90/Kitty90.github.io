	<h4>The time has come for summer recipes! First up: Salmorejo, a chilled tomato soup that can easily be made
	vegan or vegetarian.</h4>

<br><p>Salmorejo is a very simple chilled soup from Córdoba, Andalucía (southern Spain), that I like to call 
'blended breakfast soup'. That might not sound very appealing, but the first time I was preparing it, 
I realized that Salmorejo consists of the same ingredients as the typical Spanish breakfast 
<em>Pan con tomate</em> (toasted bread with grated tomatoes, garlic, olive oil and ham). 
"Bless the Spanish", I thought. They have not only succeeded in inventing a simple treat for 
breakfast with these ingredients, their climate has probably inspired them to combine the same
 flavors in a chilled soup. Just the recipe we need to kick off summer!</p>

<h5><a name="recipe">Recipe: Salmorejo</h5>
<p><br><b>Ingredients ( <span itemprop="recipeYield">serves4</span>)</b>
<ul>
	<span itemprop="ingredients"><li>1 kg (35 oz) tomatoes</li></span>
	<span itemprop="ingredients"><li>1 clove of garlic</li></span>
	<span itemprop="ingredients"><li>200 g (7 oz) stale bread, shredded into smaller bits</li></span>
	<span itemprop="ingredients"><li>150 ml (2/3 cup) extra virgin olive oil</li></span>
	<span itemprop="ingredients"><li>optional: 4 hard boiled eggs (leave out to veganize the recipe)</li></span>
	<span itemprop="ingredients"><li>1 green bell pepper</li></span>
	<span itemprop="ingredients"><li>optional: 2 slices of jamón Serrano (leave out to veganize the recipe)</li></span>
</ul></p>
<p><b>Method</b>
<ol itemprop="recipeInstructions"> 
	<li>To dry the Serrano ham, pre-heat the oven to 160 C / 325 F and put the slices on an oven tray covered with baking paper.</li>
	<li>To peel the tomatoes, put a generous amount of water in a pot (enough to submerse the tomatoes) and bring to boil.</li>
	<li>Cut tiny crosses in the bottoms of the tomatoes. When the water is boiling, add the tomatoes and leave in the pot for 30 seconds.</li>
	<li>After 30 seconds, take out the tomatoes with a soup ladle, place them in a colander and rinse with cold water. Leave to cool down a bit.</li>
	<li>Meanwhile, put the tray with Serrano ham slices into the oven. Check regularly, the ham is done when it is dry, crispy and breaks when bent.</li>
	<li>Starting at the edges of the crosses, peel the skin of the tomatoes and put them in a bowl, blender or kitchen machine.</li>
	<li>Add the clove of garlic to the bowl and blend the tomatoes until the mixture has a smooth, frothy texture.</li>
	<li>Add the stale bread by the handfuls, mixing the bread into the soup after adding each handful.</li>
	<li>After adding the bread, add the olive oil and mix thoroughly.</li>
	<li>Let the soup chill in the refrigerator and take the ham out of the oven, if it is inflexible and crispy.</li>
	<li>While the soup is cooling down, prepare the garnish. Cut the green pepper into small cubes, hard-boil two eggs (min. 8 min boiling time) and cut them in halves, and break the ham slices into shards.</li>
	<li>When chilled, stir the soup again to mix the substance properly and ladle into bowls.</li>
	<li>Garnish the soup with two halves of hard-boiled eggs, some green pepper and ham shards.</li>
</ol></p>
