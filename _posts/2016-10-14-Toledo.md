<h4>A week ago my boyfriend had to go to Alcalá de Henares for a conference, naturally, I did not shy away from the opportunity to go on a little exploration of my new home country. We went on a little road trip and crossed the country into the heart of Spain to experience all the natural drama our route had to offer. </h4>

<p>Driving through Spain is uncovering its versatility in culture, history and lancscapes. As we left Málaga, we left behind the dramatic rugged coastlines and beaches, only to find ourselves among equally dramatic Sierra Nevada, white villages and the Moorish culture of Andalucía. In Jaén, we saw miles and miles of olive orchards that will be turned into Spain's liquid gold, and finally entered the dry, inner plateau in Castilla-la Mancha where grain fields extend beyond the horizon and scattered derelict castles and white windmills reminded us of times long past and heralded in medieval literature.</p>

<p><b>Alcalá de Henares</b><br>
Since work had to be done we didn't have a lot of time to explore Alcalá, but fortunately it lends itself very well to being explored in a few hours. We spent the afternoon meandering its cobblestone streets lined with sandstone buildings housing traditional cafes that offer honest Spanish food. This quaint town, as well as its historic university campus left a very positive impression on us. Alcalá de Henares may be small, but what it lacks in size it makes up for with its history and cultural ambiance.</p> 

This town, or more specifically one of its citizens, has had significant influence on Spanish literature. Miguel de Cervantes, writer and author of the best selling Spanish book of all time, Don Quixote, was born in Alcala in 1547. The town has become somewhat of a place of pilgrimage for literature buffs drawn to the <a href="http://www.museocasanataldecervantes.org/information/">Cervantes Birth House Museum</a>. 

<p><b>Toledo</b><br>
After the conference had ended we started our return south with a stopover in Toledo. The town is recognized as a UNESCO World Heritage Site, and with good reason, but keep in mind that such a claim to fame also means that is popular among both national and foreign tourists, so accommodation can be relatively pricey. We had managed to find a nice Airbnb outside of the historic centre that offered a parking spot (parking in Spanish city centres is not for the faint-hearted or impatient). However, the historic city centre of Toledo is perched on a hill and we had to take an escalator to get to the top from the modern outer parts of the city.</p> 

Toledo is considered Spain's medieval capital of three cultures. In the Early Middle Ages, the walled city housed Jewish and Christian groups, while the city was still under Visigothic rule. Arabic influences were added to the blend of cultures when Toledo came under Moorish rule in 712 AD.  Remnants of all three cultures can still be found in the city today; the city is home to a <a href="https://jguideeurope.org/en/region/spain/castile-mancha-castile-leon/toledo/">Jewish quarter and synagogues</a> with Arabic architectural influences, Muslim baths, the <a href="https://toledomonumental.com/cristo-luz">Cristo de la Luz mosque</a>, a <a href="http://www.catedralprimada.es/"> cathedral</a> and churches.<br><br>

Walking through Toledo's narrow streets you cannot help but feel like you're traveling back in time and getting a hint of its former glory. Ominous sounding streets "Alley of the Devil" and "Alley of Hell" instill a sense of religious fear that I often feel must have been omnipresent in the Dark Ages. characteri The city still honors its reputation as a town of craftsmanship. You can still find shops that sell metalwork and swords, although of course they cater more to tourists now since their original source of chivalrous clientele has dried up. 

Unfortunately, we did not have more time to explore everything this city has to offer (paintings by El Greco, the synagogue and cathedral), but I have seen enough to know that Toledo is a town that I'd gladly pay another visit.<br><br>
