<h4>Bilbao was the culinary highlight of our road trip through the Spanish provinces of Cantabria and the Basque Country.  
The Basque capital should be on every foodie's bucket list; it's often said that the best Spanish food is served in Bilbao. 
Intrigued, I took it upon myself to explore the fine art of pintxo cuisine and the Guggenheim Museum. 
Naturally, it's made me more cultured than two-month-old yoghurt. Here are my tips on 
where to eat in Bilbao. <!--To read about my vist to the Guggenheim, click here.--></h4>

<h5>Introducing Bilbao</h5>
<p>Bilbao is the capital of the Basque Country, an autonomous region in northern Spain. Historically, Bilbao was an industrial
port city, but the city has been given a complete makeover over the last decades and is now held in high regard in Spain as 
the city where things 'work'. Internationally, Bilbao has made a name for itself as a hotspot for high-end cuisine and fine art venues.</p>

<p>The food was relatively more expensive than what we're used to in Málaga, 
but the generale rule about dining out in Spain holds true here as well: breaking the piggybank is absolutely unnecessary.
I also have to admit that the food in Bilbao, although pricier, is good value; dishes and bites are 
of a higher quality and more interesting in terms of technique and flavor complexity.</p>

<p>We kicked off our evening in Bilbao at 
<a href="http://www.guretoki.com/about-us" target="_blank">Gure Toki</a>, an award-winning <em>pintxo</em> (Basque tapas) bar
on the photogenic Plaza Nueva. The pintxos were hard to resist, having been put on display on the bar like mouthwatering 
miniature works of haute cuisine. We carefully and painstakingly weighed our options and had two rounds of pintxos that we washed down with a local <em>txakoli</em> 
(Basque white wine).</p>

<p>We seriously considered ordering more pintxos, but in the end thought it best to go for a little walk and then
head to a restaurant for dinner. After a nice walk through the old city centre we went to 
<a href="https://lavinadelensanche.com/en/" target="_blank">La Viña del Ensanche</a>. 
This restaurant specializes in two things: red wine and jamón. And I can only say they do it outstandingly well. 
We ordered <em>josellinis au gratin</em>: Iberian pork loin with melted cheese and foie on toasted, honeycombed crystal bread, 
<em>carrilleras</em> (Iberian pork cheeks stewed in red wine) with mashed potato and a bottle of Luís Cañas Rioja to go with it. We knew La Viña served good food, but this exceeded 
our expectations by lightyears. The combination of the Iberian ham with the foie was exquisite and the pork cheeks were so tender we were given dessert spoons
to eat them. As the food was so good, we decided to crown our dinner with desserts: a red fruit gratin and apple tiramisu, both served with cream cheese ice cream.
The verdict: suffice it to say that there is footage of me cleaning the plate with my finger.</p>

<p>After a good night's sleep thanks to the Rioja, we went to the Guggenheim Museum the next morning.
Having spent the entire morning walking around the museum, our stomachs were ready for our final feast in Bilbao before heading to the airport. We 
decided to go to a common lunchroom. In Spain, workers often have long lunch hours and go to a restaurant that has a set
(three-course) menu that is often very reasonably priced. We found a little gem called <a href="http://www.restaurantearalar.eu/en/">Aralar</a> right before the lunch rush hour.
We ordered a warm chard salad with ham (because I was eager to have some veggies) and cod in puff pastry as starters. As mains we had
bonito fish with caramelized onions, and pork loin in a reduction of Pedro Ximenez (sherry wine). For dessert, we had gin & tonic cheesecake and carrot cake. 
That doesn't sound too bad, huh? It was delicious, and the bill almost gave it an even sweeter aftertaste. Including the bottle of Rioja, it cost a mere 17 euros per person. 
Bellies full and satisfied, we were sad to leave Bilbao as we felt there probably were so many more foodie gems. I can only hope that we'll 
get the chance to help ourselves to a second serving of Bilbao.</p>

<h5><a name="travelinfo">Getting to Bilbao</h5>
<p>Have I wet your appetite for a trip to Bilbao? The city has an international airport (European flights). 
Getting to the city centre from the airport is easy with the airport shuttle service; buses run every 30 mins. 
Alternatively you can take the bus or train from major cities in Spain. Flixbus services major cities throughout Europe.</p>
