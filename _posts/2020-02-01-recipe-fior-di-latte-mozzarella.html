<h4>It is a truth universally acknowledged, that the Italians have turned cooking into an art. 
    So, it comes as no surprise that in a country where all arts are revered, good food is spoken 
    of in the most loving and poetic terms.</h4>

<p>Don't believe me? Look at the title of this recipe. 
Fior di latte literally means 'flower of milk'. A most fitting name for this soft-flavoured, 
moist and gooey cheese.  In other countries, Fior di latte is referred to as Mozzarella, 
but it should be noted that these two terms are not interchangeable in Italy. 
In Italy,  Fior di latte is made from cow milk, whereas Mozzarella refers to Mozzarella di bufala, 
which is made from buffalo milk and has a much stronger taste than Fior di latte.</p>

<p>I can only share a recipe for fior di latte with you, as there are plenty of cows, 
but no buffaloes in the Netherlands - at least, not that I'm aware of.  
It may be surprising, but this recipe is quite simple - making Mozzarella is not just for Italian experts!</p>

<h5><a name="recipe">Recipe: Fior di Latte ~ Homemade Mozzarella</h5>
<br><p><b>Ingredients (for 2 balls of fior di latte)</b>
<ul>
	<li>2 l / 0.5 gallon of unpasteurized milk*</li>
	<li>1/4 of a rennet tablet</li>
	<li>3/4 tsp citric acid powder</li>
	<li>water</li>
</ul>
*You can use pasteurised, refrigerated whole milk as long as it is not ultra pasteurised (UHT). 
However, I strongly suggest getting raw milk from a local farm, as pasteurized milk might not curdle properly.</p>

<p><b>Equipment</b>
<ul>
	<li>kitchen thermometer</li>
	<li>cheesecloth</li>
	<li>strainer</li>
	<li>2 pots</li>
</ul></p>
<p><b>Method</b>
<ol>
	<li>Dissolve the 1/4 rennet tablet in half a cup of water, stir the mixture and let it rest.</li>
	<li>Dissolve the citric acid powder in half a cup of water.</li>
	<li>Pour the milk into a large pot and add the citric acid mixture. Heat this mixture to 32 C / 89.6 F, stirring frequently to prevent burning.</li>
	<li>Add the rennet mixture and stir for about 30 seconds and then leave it to rest. Heat this mixture to 40 C / 104 F.</li>
	<li>The milk should curdle, separating into two parts. Curdling might take up to 45 minutes if your milk is pasteurised.  You should have a solid, thick yogurt-like substance (the curds) and a yellow liquid (the whey).  If the whey stays white and milky, heat the mixture to 43 C / 109.4 F.</li>
	<li>While the milk is curdling, place the cheesecloth in a strainer over a pot.</li>
	<li>Once the milk has curdled, cut into square inch (2.5 cm) cubes.</li>
	<li>Pour the curds and the whey over the cheesecloth to separate them.</li>
	<li>Once the curds have been drained, scoop them from the strainer into a bowl and form them into a ball.</li>
	<li> Fill a large pot with water and nestle the strainer into the pot. There should be enough water in the pot to submerge the curds when put into the strainer. Warm the water to 87 C / 190 F.</li>
	<li>Put the curds in the strainer and let them sit for five minutes.</li>
	<li>After five minutes, take the curds out, sprinkle them with salt and work the salt into the cheese.</li>
	<li>Now you are going to stretch the cheese. Try stretching the cheese. If it tears and breaks, put it back into the strainer to warm it up more. If the cheese stretches without tearing, fold it back and stretch again  repeatedly.</li>
	<li>Once the cheese becomes firm and shiny, you are ready to start forming balls, but be careful not to overwork the cheese.</li>
	<li>You can use the Mozzarella straight away or keep it refrigerated for one week.  To refrigerate, cover the cheese and put it in an airtight container.</li>
</ol>
Buon appetito!</p>
