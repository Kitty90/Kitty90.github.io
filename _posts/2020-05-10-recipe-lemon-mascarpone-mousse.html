<h4>How about celebrating Mother's Day with a nice dessert? We all love a good mousse, 
    but when we're having an instant craving for mousse we find ourselves in trouble; mousse makes us wait. 
I call for a revolution.</h4>

<p>I know, all good things come to those who wait and a real mousse contains raw eggs that need setting, 
    but here's a recipe for when you don't have the patience. I just grabbed some leftovers from the fridge 
    and was quite pleased with the result: a zingy and fresh, yet sweet, soft and silky mousse that is quite 
    airy! The recipe is easy peasy lemon squeezy, takes less than 15 minutes and you can enjoy the mousse instantly - 
    if you haven't licked the entire bowl already.</p>
