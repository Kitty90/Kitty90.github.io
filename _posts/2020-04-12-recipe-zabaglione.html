<h4>Easter traditionally calls for egg-based recipes, so there is no better occasion to cook with eggnog.
	I dug up an old Italian recipe for marsala-poached pears with <em>zabaglione</em>,
	 the frontrunner of the French <em>sabayon</em>. 
</h4>
<br><p><em>Jump to <a href="#recipe">recipe</a></em>.</p>

<p>When I was a student living in a student flat I once made Zabaglione for a house mate. 
	I had just moved out of my parents' house to study in a different 
 city and I was faced with having to fend for myself in the kitchen. So far, my house mate was not very 
 pleased with my first attempts. He was puzzled by what the food I had served him was supposed to be, 
 and had asked me for the name of the dish. "Zabaglione", I said rather proudly. Unfortunately, 
 this only made things worse, as my house mate laughed and responded,"What? Zabaglione? You mean Sabayon!"</p>

<p>No, I did not mean Sabayon! I meant Zabaglione, an egg-based dessert like eggnog, 
    Dutch Advocaat or Central American Rompope. It is a classic Italian dish that is traditionally made 
    with a sweet white wine like Moscato or Marsala, sugar and raw egg yolks. It is absolutely delicious - 
    my boyfriend told me he loved me twice while eating this - but strangely enough, people around me 
    always go blank whenever I talk about this dish. This intermission of ignorance takes about 5 
    seconds and then they light up, saying I must be meaning Sabayon! The lit up faces turn into 
    confused looks when I dare to even suggest that French Sabayon is based upon Italian Zabaglione! 
    It always raises a discussion about which came first, the Sabayon or the Zabaglione, 
    the chicken or the egg? I say the egg, and from that egg came the first delicious Italian Zabaglione.</p>

<h5><a name="recipe">Recipe: Zabaglione</h5>
<br><p><b>Ingredients (serves 4)</b>
<ul>
	<li>200 ml sweet Italian wine (Moscato or Marsala)</li>
	<li>4 ripe pears</li>
	<li>4 egg yolks</li>
	<li>50 g sugar</li>
	<li>1 cinnamon stick</li>
	<li>1/2 star anise</li>
	<li>a handful of walnuts</li>
</ul></p>
<p><b>Method</b>
<ol>
	<li>Leaving the stem on, peel the pears and slice them into halves lengthwise. Cut out the hearts.</li>
	<li>Put the pears, the wine, the sugar, cinnamon stick and star anise in a pot and bring to a boil. Turn down the heat and leave to simmer for 15 - 20 minutes with the lid on.</li>
	<li>Once the pears are properly poached, they should have a glazy, glistening gloss to them. Take them out of the pot.</li>
	<li>Reduce the liquid to 100 ml and sieve it. Set the reduced pear juice aside for the Zabaglione.</li>
	<li>Beat the egg yolks in a bowl with a tablespoon of sugar until the egg yolks are glistening and almost white.</li>
	<li>Cook the Zabaglione au bain marie: put the bowl with egg yolks on a pot with boiling water and add the reduced pear liquid while continuously stirring slowly. Stir until the Zabaglione thickens and almost stops running.</li>
	<li>To serve, put 2 poached pear halves on each plate and pour over the Zabaglione, sprinkle some walnuts over and around the Zabaglione and serve warm.</li>
