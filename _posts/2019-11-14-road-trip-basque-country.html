<h5><a name="day1"></a>Day 1</h5>
<p><b>San Juan de Gaztelugatxe</b><br>
    Start your road trip in San Juan de Gaztelugatxe, north of Bilbao. San Juan is a 
    small hermitage in the most picturesque location imaginable: atop a rock in the middle of the sea. You can only reach the hermitage via a footpath consisting of
    a series of steep stairs, first down the mainland mountain and then across the sea and up the rock. Although the views are more than worth it, the hike is not for the faint-hearted (for reference, I 
    run half marathons and go to the gym, but when I got back to the car after this hike my shirt definitely needed washing). 
<p>If this place looks familiar, it's because you might have seen it in a little show called Game of Thrones. 
    The rock with the hermitage and dwindling staircase was the film location for Dragonstone in the seventh season of GoT. After the obligatory
    photo-op and ringing of the church bells, make your way back to the car and drive to Bermeo or the surfer town of Mundaka for a 
well-deserved lunch.</p>

<br><p><b>Urdaibai Biosphere Reserve or Gernika (Guernica)</b><br>
    After lunch, nature lovers should go and explore the Urdaibai Biosphere Reserve. The reserve is a protected area that is of crucial importance to 
    bird migrations, so it's a must for birdwatchers. If you want to learn more about (global) bird migrations and the birds in the reserve, 
    pay a visit to the Urdaibai Bird Center, which would also make an excellent outing for kids! Here you can take a very informative audio-tour and 
    there are a watchtower and viewpoints with binoculars that offer excellent views of the biosphere reserve.</p>
<p>If you're more into history and culture, drive farther south to the town of Gernika (Guernica). This town played a central role in Basque 
    history and is still considered a symbol of Basque culture. In the center of town, you will find the Tree of Gernika, under which administrative and 
    political assemblies were held. Different administrative districts in Biscay all had their own Trees of Assembly, but the one in Guernica was the scene
    of many important political events between the Basques and the Castilians. Apart from the area surrounding the tree the town itself does not have much of a historical 
    or charming center as it was bombed in 1937 by Nazi German air forces and the event, known as the Guernica Bombings, 
    inspired Picasso's famous 'Guernica' painting.

<br><p>At the end of the day, you can drive to San Sebastian already, or alternatively, stay in one of the towns along the coast or in Urdaibai.
    We stayed in Elantxobe, a small fishing town dramatically perched on a cliff overlooking its harbor and the ocean. 
</p>

<h5><a name="day2"></a>Day 2</h5>
<p><b>San Sebastian</b><br>
    Start your day early and drive to Donostia (San Sebastian). From Elantxobe the drive takes 1.5 hours. San Sebastian has two beaches: Kontxako west of the river and Zurriola is east of 
    the river and particularly popular among surfers. The most interesting sights are all located roughly between the two beaches. 
    Be sure to check out:
    <ul>
        <li>Old town north of city hall, where you'll find many pintxo bars and delicacy stores.</li>
        <li>San Telmo Museum, whose collections explore Basque history and culture</li>
        <li>Kursaal Congress Center and Auditorium</li>
        <li>Monte Igueldo, offering spectacular views of the bay and the city</li>
        <li>Castillo de la Mota, housing Casa de la Historia, a museum about the city's history</li>
    </ul>

</div><br>
    You can either spend the night in San Sebastian, or drive back in the direction of Urdaibai so you can get up early the next day to go 
    hiking in Gorliz. Alternatively, drive along the coast to Bilbao from San Sebastian if you'd like to have more time in the capital.
    On the way to Bilbao, be sure to make stopovers in one or two charming coastal towns such as Zarautz and Lekeitio 
    (surfer towns), or Zumaia (rock formations).   
</p>
<h5><a name="day3"></a>Day 3</h5>
<p><b>Hiking in Gorliz</b><br>
    Gorliz is a small surf town 30 kilometers (17.5 miles) north of Bilbao. If you're not much of a surfer, like me, then Gorliz offers 
    a great hiking trail that starts east of the beach and the seafront hospital, going up the hill. The trail we hiked is 10 kilometers, and led us
    through a wild pony reserve to a lighthouse. You can find the route <a href="https://www.wikiloc.com/hiking-trails/gorliz-faro-ermua-gorliz-circular-6097243">here</a> on Wikiloc. If you're not up for a long hike, you can find other circular 
    routes to the Gorliz lighthouse and back on Wikiloc, such as <a href="https://www.wikiloc.com/hiking-trails/faro-de-gorliz-7735051">
    this 5-kilometer hike</a>. After the hike, drive to Bilbao and treat yourself to a nice meal. See my post
    <a href="">Where to Eat in Bilbao</a> for non-vegetarian options (I'm not a strict vegan, I allow myself an unethical splurge 
    every once in a while).

<h5><a name="day4">Day 4</h5>
    <p>On your final day, take your time to explore the cultural and foodie capital of the Basque Country.
        Be sure not to miss:
        <ul>
            <li>The Guggenheim Museum Bilbao</li>
            <li>Casco Viejo (old town, lots of pintxo bars!)</li>
            <li>Euskal Museoa: Museum of Basque Culture</li>
            <li>Portugalete neighborhood</li>

<h5><a name="travelinfo">How to Get to the Basque Coast</h5>
    <p>Bilbao and San Sebastian both have international airports and are connected to major Spanish cities via rail and bus lines. It is 
        best to check Google Maps and the ALSA (bus company) and ALVIA (train company) websites to see which public transport type offers 
        the best connection. Traveling to Bilbao by bus is often faster than by train. For example, Madrid - Bilbao is 4 hours by bus, 
        but 5 hours by train.
