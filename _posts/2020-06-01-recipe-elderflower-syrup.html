<h4>During my daily walks, I have started to notice that a particular spring fragrance has filled the air: that of elderflower blossom. 
    I love the smell of elderflower so much I could drown in it. As it turns out, you could, in theory, because 
    these blossoms can be made into a delicious elderflower syrup, or elderflower cordial, which is great for making lemonade, or sprucing up 
    cocktails (especially G&T) and desserts.

<h5>Foraging Elderflower</h5>
<p>Elderflowers grow in Europe, northwest Africa and southwest Asia. In late May and June it's hard to miss the distinct
    fragrance of elderflower blossoms when out in nature, because these bushes are not that hard to find! They grow in forests,
    on the roadside, preferably in sunny spots. When you go out looking for elderflower, look for a a bush with a rough, rugged brown trunk.
    The leaves of the elderflower are oval and smooth. The flowers grow in <em>corymbs</em>, with many stems leading the flowers to the same flat level.
    These fans of flowers can be 10-25 cm in diameter, whereas the flowers are only half a centimeter big and have five petals.
