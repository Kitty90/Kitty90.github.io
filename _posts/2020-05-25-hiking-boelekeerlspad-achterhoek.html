<h4>As a distinct cultural region, de Achterhoek has its own folktales. One of these is about the Bogeyman, or <em>Boelekeerl</em> in local dialect, 
and it even has its own hiking trail nestled between the towns of Zelhem, Doetinchem and Halle. Last weekend we hiked the 6 kilometer long 'Boelekeerlspad' and were awarded with an abundance 
of wildlife; The area is well known as a good place to spot roe deer that are attracted to the watering holes. 
We didn't see any roe deer, but we did see hares, sheep, frogs, many birds and even a grass snake!</h4>

<h5>About "the Boelekeerl"</h5>
<p>The Boelekeerl is an old local folk figure; the story goes he lives in ponds and creeks and snatches and drowns children that get too close
    to the water. Of course the tale used to be told to prevent kids from going near the water, accidentally falling in and drowning.
    I'd never heard of this folktale before, but was surprised to hear my mom was raised with it.

<h5><a name="trail">About the Bogeyman trail</h5>
<p> The best starting point is the carpark at Jolinkdijk in Zelhem. Alternatively you can start from the Boldiek farm, which is also a nice
    place to have a coffee during or after your walk. There's a playground for children at the farm as well.  
    The trail is lovely and well signposted with green plaques that read "Boelekeerlspad". 
    The path goes along fenns, marshes, creeks, past moors and meadows, and through forests. 
    Halfway down the trail, close to Boldiek farm you will come across the Boelekeerls' pond. 
    Next to the pond you'll find a sign explaining the folktale and a groundwater meter.
