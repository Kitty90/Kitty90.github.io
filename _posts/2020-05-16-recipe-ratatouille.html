<h4>Saturday usually is my market day. Which means that on Saturday morning, my pantry and fridge should be nearly empty 
	and it's time to perform my consumerist duties and stock up on fresh vegetables for the coming week. 
	On Friday I discovered that I still had zucchinis, aubergines and bell peppers in the fridge and they 
	had to make space. So, I had the perfect excuse to make a ratatouille, but it got me wondering, 
	what is a traditional ratatouille, really?</h4>

<br><p><em>Jump to <a href="#recipe">recipe</a></em>.</p>

<p>In the name of culinary research, I delved into the world of French cooking and recipe websites. 
	It has been a few years since I studied French and I was plowing through French articles and posts on 
	ratatouille's origin, trying to unravel the mysteries of both language and cuisine, but the findings were 
	inconclusive. To my linguistic heart's content, I discovered that the Dutch word 'ratjetoe', a word 
	referring to a little mess, is derived from French Ratatouille. The name couldn't have been more fitting,
	 as I found myself in a ratjetoe of theories about the dish's origin.</p>

<p>It turns out, there is no real Ratatouille, although there seems to be a traditional method of preparing 
	the dish. Regarding its origin, the general consensus is that Ratatouille is Provençale (France), 
	but the Catalans (Spain) claim the dish, too, albeit under the name of Samfaina. 
	All these varieties from different regions seemed to have one thing in common: there are rules to 
	preparing ratatouille. The most important and universal rule I've found is that the vegetables should 
	all be cooked separately before being added to the tomato sauce, to ensure that they maintain their own 
	flavors. So, there was my first step in the right direction.</p>

<p>However, I found out that, apart from cooking the vegetables  separately, all bets are off! 
	Some use only thyme to flavor the dish, others use a plethora of Provencal and Mediterranean 
	herbs like rosemary, parsley, basil and laurel. Some prepare the dish in the oven, others in a pot, 
	some cut the vegetables in cubes, others imitate the popularized Disney Ratatouille with vegetable slices.
	My head was spinning, <em>Mon dieu! </em>I didn't know what's wrong and what's right anymore. 
	Did it really matter, if the taste was right anyway? I didn't think so. 
	This is my little mess, my 'ratjetoe'; an authentic ratatouille according to some, and let that be the end of it.</p>
