<h4>Although COVID-19 forced us to curtail our travels in Asia, the measures in the Netherlands are relatively lenient, so we still enjoy the possibility to go out and explore my home region and country. And what an endearing place it is! Having been abroad for four years now allows me to see the Netherlands with fresh eyes. </h4> 


<p>The weather has been so lovely since our return from Asia, and we have tried to make the most of it by going on hiking and cycling trips in the neighborhood. Last weekend we decided to go a bit farther afield and drove to a nature reserve called <a href="https://www.visitveluwe.com/">'de Veluwe'</a>.</p>

<p><b>About De Veluwe</b><br>
De Veluwe is a nature reserve that consists of two national parks: <a href="https://www.hogeveluwe.nl/en">De Hoge Veluwe National Park</a> and <a href="https://www.natuurmonumenten.nl/natuurgebieden/nationaal-park-veluwezoom">National Park Veluwezoom</a> (Dutch only). Additionally, the region comprises other nature reserves such as Deelerwoud, Leuvenumse Bossen, Planken Wambuis, Wolfheze, and Oud Groevenbeek.  

The entire area is located in the heart of the Netherlands, roughly nestled between the cities of Arnhem, Apeldoorn, Amersfoort and Harderwijk. De Hoge Veluwe National Park is also home to the <a href="https://krollermuller.nl/en">Kröller-Müller Museum</a> which boasts the second-largest Van Gogh collection in the world, as well as works by Monet, Mondriaan, Picasso, and Seurat.</p> 

<p><b>Flora and Fauna in De Veluwe</b><br>
De Veluwe is known for deciduous, coniferous and mixed forests; (purple) moor- and grasslands; sand drifts; lakes; and abundant wildlife. Nature enthusiasts have a good chance of spotting the Dutch 'big five': red deer, roe deer, wild boars, foxes and mouflons (a wild sheep native to Corse and Sardinia). Additionally, the park is teeming with birds and Scottish Highland cows roam around to their hearts' content.</p>

<p><b>Hiking in De Veluwe</b><br>
Hikers visiting De Hoge Veluwe National Park receive a free map upon paying the €2,50 entrance fee at the visitor's center. The remaining regions in de Veluwe are maintained by Dutch nature preserve organization <a href="https://www.natuurmonumenten.nl/routes?locatie=N_1802&locatie-naam=De+Veluwe&page=1">Natuurmonumenten</a>.</p> 

<p><b>Our Hike through Deelerwoud</b><br>
We decided to do a <a href="https://www.natuurmonumenten.nl/natuurgebied/deelerwoud/route/wandelroute-deelerwoud-veluwe">9 km hike through Deelerwoud</a>, an area between the two national parks. The moor was relatively barren and brown, due to the dry weather the Netherlands had been having. We were glad to enjoy the sunshine though, as it imbued the landscape with the excitement of spring. The route takes you around a moor where Scottish Highlanders are grazing. Contrary to what its name suggests, the Deelerwoud route does not lead you through very wooded areas; it mostly guides you along a moor. Although this is quite an exceptional landscape in the Netherlands, it does tend to get a rather monotonous walking along it for 9 kilometres. Nonetheless, we had a beautiful day in nature and felt like we were in a different country altogether! We will definitely come back to do another route if the weather and time permit it.</p>
