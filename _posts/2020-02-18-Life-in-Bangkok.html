<p>Before we dive in, here's how victorious I was in defeating my jet lag after writing the previous blog post: </p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img src="https://i2.wp.com/paid-leave.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/IMG_20200212_135130-scaled.jpg?fit=840%2C1020&amp;ssl=1" alt="" class="wp-image-375"/></figure>
<p>I'm quite proud that I wasn't drooling all over my pillow. Anyway, moving on... </p>
<p>Our second workweek in Thailand has started and I guess you can say that we have developed a little bit of a routine. 
I know that sounds boring and the saying goes <em>'variety is the spice of life' </em> but when in Thailand, 
spiciness abounds - and I'm not just referring to the food... or the bathroom for that matter. </p>

<p>As was to be expected, we were confronted with a little bit of a culture shock the first couple of days. 
Nothing too serious, don't worry, just a general fascination with all things 'abnormal', 
or so they seem in the eyes of these <em>falangs</em> (Thai derogatory word for <em>foreigners</em>). 
Here are some of the oddities we documented:</p>

<img src="/assets/images/bangkok2.jpg">
<ul>
    <li>ridiculous flavours of crisps: Hot Chili Squid, Baked Cheese with Tamarind Paste, Salted Egg, Mieng Kam Krob Ros (whatever that may be), and Khua Kling Curry Pizza (curry pizza, sure!)</li>
    <li>UV protection clothes </li>
    <li>UV lightening body lotion (it's hard to come by a 'normal' body lotion here)</li>
    <li>frog egg juice, anyone?</li>
    <li>hazardous zebra crossings </li>
    <li>durian fruit prohibitions (because they smell like sweaty feet)</li>
</ul>

<p>The first week was filled with these weird realisations, but at the same time we were trying to establish a normal 
routine. So how's our life in Thailand <em>same same, but different</em>?</p>

<h4>Work</h4>
<p><strong>Same same</strong>: Yup, money still needs to be made. We still get to attend our meetings, 
because the time difference is fairly limited (6 hours). </p>
<p><strong>But different</strong>: We go to a coworking space a couple hundred metres from our hotel. 
For 8 euros per day we get an airconditioned workplace with access to conference areas, 
free coffee and snacks and proper WiFi. Not bad. </p>

<h4>People</h4>
<p><strong>Same same: </strong>Go to a mall. You will see the same status-crazy obsession fuelled by western consumerism. Even the models look western because they got their eyelids 'done'. </p>
<p><strong>But different: </strong>Everybody smiles at you <strong>all the time. </strong>
What's interesting is that losing face is a huge deal here. 
We noticed this when dealing with taxi drivers trying to rip us off; when they realise you know the meter should be used and you're not going to pay three times the normal fare, things get a bit awkward. They know and you know, that they're being sleazy and since that's so embarrassing they're trying to make light of the situation and get on your good side again. All of a sudden they give you back the correct change instead of rounding up your fare and tipping themselves for you. </p>

<h4>Food</h4>
<p><strong>Same same: </strong>Ha! Well we still eat about three meals per day and at the regular times, 
but that's about it... </p>
<p><strong>But different: </strong>We go to the food stalls at the food court downstairs from our cowork for breakfast and lunch. 
Breakfast, an omelette with toppings and rice, costs 40 Baht (1.20 euros) and the portion is big enough for me and Manu to share. Lunch is about 2 euros, unless you want western food.... 
but you don't want that because they make the weirdest combinations of western ingredients. </p>
<p>We <strong>love </strong>the food here, but yes, we're starting to get tired of rice already. 
The flavours of dishes are amazing, complex and well-balanced but generally every meal consists of rice with a little bit of meat and even less vegetables. 
The rule seems to be: if you can have it for dinner then you can have it for breakfast as well. Yes, even deep-fried pork if you want your breakfast with a side of constipation. 
We have found that the protein / veggie / carb ratio seems to be more balanced at restaurants where you pay a bit more than at the food stalls. </p>
<p>Fruit juices come with a truckload of sugar, so we have started asking for ours without added sugar. All the fresh produce you get is jampacked with flavour already. Honestly, I have never tasted fresh fruit as sweet as here. </p>

<h4>Gym</h4>
<p><strong>Same same:</strong> Resistance bands to the rescue! We're doing quite a bit of walking as well and this weekend we cycled around Ayutthaya the whole afternoon... but yes... I miss the gym. </p>
<p><strong>But different: </strong>Staying healthy seems to be a luxury. Gyms are relatively expensive here (think, the same amount you would pay in Holland or Spain) and therefore we decided not to sign up at a gym here in Bangkok but to wait until we're in Ko Lanta. Running in Bangkok traffic and humidity is not for the faint-hearted. </p>
<p>I'll leave it at this for now, even though I haven't even discussed our neighbourhood or our first weekend yet. It's time to head home and do some laundry. Yup, same same as at home, not very different.... or so I expect. </p>
