<h4>
Ajoblanco is a traditional Spanish soup from  Málaga, in the southern-most region of Spain, Andalusia. 
Similar to other Andalusian summer soups, such as gazpacho and salmorejo, ajoblanco is served chilled, 
so it provides a welcome relief from the scorching hot Andalusian summers. 
One warning: as you'll soon find out, this dish is not a suitable pre-date night meal!</h4>

<br><p>As the name and picture already suggest, this soup is white, although it is not based on a roux. 
The distinct white colour of Ajo Blanco comes from its white ingredients: the traditional Andalusian almonds, 
the white bread and, yes, the garlic. These ingredients also give ajoblanco a very striking taste. 
The notes of olive oil, almonds and garlic are noticeably present, but should not be too overpowering. 
The addition of the white wine vinegar balances out the oily flavour, 
and the grape or melon garnish gives the dish a sweetness that ensures that it is not too spicy or bitter. 
I believe that it is also a dish that is very easy to adjust to your own taste by changing the amounts of the ingredients. 
However, no matter what you do or how much you enjoy the taste, for your environment's sake, brush your teeth afterwards.</p>
